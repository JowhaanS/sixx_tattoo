# Sixx Tattoo

A Flutter project I'm trying to write as I'm studying application development..
We do not study/learn Flutter so I'm "on my own" here, but it's great fun!

## About:

This project is supposed to be for a Tattoo studio, mainly as an adaptive webpage
It'll probably be a mess at first but I'll try refactor as I go..
However, I'll try launch it on google play and testflight eventually.

## "Big" features to be implemented:

- Firebase as backend to take care of images/gallery & booking
- Swish integration for payment, there'll be a refundable booking fee
